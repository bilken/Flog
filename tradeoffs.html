<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>
    Back in 2010, I worked on an embedded C/C++ project that had some
    terrible logging code. The target platforms had no debug facilities
    (JTAG or otherwise), just some slow serial output. The lack of
    debugging features made logging a critical feature. Yet, it was
    really terrible.
</p>
<p>
    It was clear what was wrong with the existing logging code:
    <ul>
        <li>It was incosistent. Different modules used different logging
            APIs (I guess depending on who wrote it or when). Different
            compile-time configurations were required to enable the code
            in each type.</li>
        <li>Compile-time configuration was largely all or nothing. There
            was no fine-grained control of small portions of the code
            base. Enabling debug level logging bloated the code size so
            much that it wouldn't load on some of the target platforms. On
            all target platforms, debug logging would flood the serial
            port and make the product unusable. In other words, the
            compile-time configuration was useless because it lacked
            fine-grained control.</li>
        <li>There was no run-time configuration.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately -- or perhaps exactly what one should expect in this
    profession -- the customer asked us to change as little as possible
    to get the features they wanted. That meant I couldn't just go through
    and "fix" all logging code.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not a complainer (much), so I added temporary debug features where
    needed. If the box wasn't behaving right, I'd pepper the suspect code
    with debug output that would print the file name and line number only.
    I could get a pretty good handle on what was going on without flooding
    the serial port or changing the system's behavior too much. I also
    added an optional circular buffer that would store the last ~32 KB of
    log output and only send on the serial port after a bad state had been
    detected.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, another group at our office was working in parallel on
    porting the system to yet another platform. Like my group, they were
    not permitted to rewrite the icky portions. But they could write their
    brand new platform code right. They wrote a logging API
    that included compile-time configuration of severities on a per-module
    basis. I thought it was pretty good. I thought it could be better.
</p>
<p>
    Then our half of the project was discontinued. And a new internal
    project was created to make an actual product. I was assigned to
    make one of the core components on that new product. At that moment,
    I vowed to do logging right because of the pain I'd suffered the
    whole year prior.
</p>
<p>
    Fast forward to now, I've been granted permission to shared this code 
    and my experiences around it. Thanks to
    <a href="http://www.flec.tv">Flashlight</a>.
    Of course, as I was preparing Flog for public consumption, I realized
    that there were serious installation and configuration issues. And I
    found a ton of other nits that I've plucked out of the thing while
    making it ready for public viewing. Basically, it's not even the
    same thing internally even though the APIs and behavior are roughly
    the same.
</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>
    The main features I wanted from logging APIs:
    <ul>
        <li>Consistency across ALL code</li>
        <li>Simple syntax</li>
        <li>Zero cost (or close to it) when inhibited</li>
        <li>Run time configurability on a per-module basis</li>
        <li>Configurable output formatting</li>
        <li>Configurable output destination(s)</li>
        <li>Compatible with C and C++</li>
        <li>Thread safe (i.e. ordered, un-mangled output)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    These requirements all seemed compatible, so I set out to design and
    write the code (sometimes not in that particular order...). Mostly,
    I'd just ask myself questions and try to come up with answers until
    I ran out of questions I couldn't answer. Is that how design is
    supposed to work?
</p>
<p>
    The current implementation of what I now call
    <a href="http://github.com/bilken/Flog/"> Flog</a> is available for
    viewing.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>"What should log calls look like?"</h3>
<p>
    I happen to like printf-style syntax, so I decided it could just do
    that. As far as the severity and module specification, I was not so
    sure. My first try looked something like this, partly because that's
    what'd I'd seen before (from the other group's project in the Preface):
    <pre>
    FLOG_DEBUG(MODULE1, "Some stuff %d\n", x);
    </pre>
</p>

<h3>"Why is the severity in the macro name but the module is a parameter?"</h3>
<p>
    Yeah, that's weird. So I made it so that both of the following are valid:
    <pre>
    FLOG(FOOSEV, BARMOD, "fmt %d\n", num);
    FLOG_FOOSEV_BARMOD("fmt %d\n", num);
    </pre>
</p>

<h3>"How do I reduce the run-time cost of inhibited log statements
    to zero?"</h3>
<p>
    Some compilers will remove unused statements like
    <pre>
    if (0) {...}
    </pre>
    Some won't, though. So I decided the preprocessor would be required
    for a truly portable solution to compile-time configuration.
    For example:
    <pre>
    #define PRINTF_OFF(FMT, ...)
    #define PRINTF_ON(FMT, ...) printf(FMT , __VA_ARGS__);
    </pre>
</p>

<h3>"How do I define modules and severities?"</h3>
<h3>"How do I define macros for each module and severity?"</h3>
<p>
    These questions are tricky and are the source of conflict within
    Flog. At first, I decided that it'd be easiest to define
    the severities and modules in a seperate configuration file. I chose
    to write a Perl script, flog_config.pl, to parse the configuration and
    generate a header with all the necessary declarations. Each
    FLOG_SEVERITY_MODULE() that should be inhibited would be defined
    to nothing. Each uninhibited call would have a valid definition.
</p>
<p>
    However, I could also solve these issues with X-macros with one
    limitation: the compile-time setting would have to be
    handled by the compiler, e.g.:
    <pre>
    'if (3 &lt; 2)'
    </pre>
    Maybe that's not true, but I couldn't think of a way to generically
    trick the preprocessor into stubbing out inhibited module/severity pairs.
    I could do it if severity was global, but not with per-module
    severities. Well, a user would have to map their entire matrix of
    module/severity pairs to true/false values. Not really reasonable.
</p>
<p>
    So, Flog supports two methods of configuration. One relies on
    the perl script but generates solid compile-time configuration.
    The other doesn't need the perl script but relies on the
    compiler to optimize away dead code.
</p>

<h3>"Are variadic macros universally supported?"</h3>
<p>
    Nope. There's basically GCC-style, C99 or just "no". It's not
    too hard to support both GCC and C99 styles with a couple #ifdefs.
    There is a little mess with C99 in order to support the no-parameter
    case:
    <pre>
    FLOG(FOOSEV, BARMOD, "No extra args\n");
    </pre>
    The mess is that I had to pass an extra empty string parameter
    and add an extra %s to the format string. That is:
    <pre>
    // Workaround for no-arg printf calls
    #define OUTPUT_ANY_ARGS(FMT, ...) printf(FMT "%s", __VA_ARGS__, "")
    </pre>
    Another option for this case would be to define a seperate FLOG0() API.
</p>
<p>
    I haven't fully decided what to do if variadic macros aren't
    supported. My original implementation was going to have compile-time
    configuration but no run-time configuration in such cases. An extra
    preprocessing tool would be run on each source file to convert all
    FLOG(FOOSEV, BARMOD, ...) calls to DP_FLOG_FOOSEV_BARMOD((...)) which
    could then be defined to nothing through the double parenthese trick
    (hence the 'DP'). This seemed pretty kludgy, especially the script
    I wrote, so I dropped it.
</p>

<h3>"How do I do run-time configuration?"</h3>
<p>
    At first, I wrote flog_get_severity() and flog_set_severity()
    (or something like that). But I never used it directly in my projects.
    Instead, I always ended up writing a little wrapper that would take
    command line or console input and adjust the logging accordingly.
    So I just plopped that code in flog.c and called it good. It now
    exists as:
    <pre>
    int flog_interact_s(const char *arg, char *outStr, size_t outStrLen);
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    This call outputs to a user-supplied string because I wasn't sure
    what else to output to. It could send directly to FLOG_PRINTF(),
    but then the syntax won't match other FLOG() calls. Or it could
    require that there be a LOG module, but that's hidden behavior.
    So I settled on letting the application decide where output should
    go, if anywhere.
</p>

<h3>"vsnprintf() crashes sometimes...why?"</h3>
<p>
    I discovered that vsnprintf() isn't strict about the string length
    I was passing in (at least with glibc). So it was crashing if
    it ran out of space (because it would keep writing past the end
    of my allocated output buffer!).
    My solution was to ... allocate a bigger buffer. Note that this
    only matters in calls to flog_interact_s() (or the test code)
    as that's the only thing that uses this call. In practice, I haven't
    had any problems with this. I definitely wouldn't expose this
    functionality to anything user accessible, though.
</p>

<h3>"What about C++?"</h3>
<p>
    At first, I was going to support output of both std::string and
    std::ostream arguments. I dropped the std::string because strings
    can be output by an ostream.
    <pre>
    FLOGS(DEBUG, MODULE1, "Text " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; std::endl);
    </pre>
    Under the covers, it creates a std::ostringstream from the contents
    of FLOGS() and passes that to the internal printf-style function as
    a single string argument (i.e. "%s", oss.str().c_str()). Note that
    it needs to check the run-time setting before doing any real work.
    If the module's severity is inhibited, the ostringstream should not
    get used (or created on the stack if possible).
</p>
<p>
    Note that since C++ output is a single expression, variadic macro
    support isn't required. I suddenly like printf-style syntax less...
    I still haven't bothered to support non-variadic compilers yet,
    though. I probably will eventually 'cause I like finishing things.
</p>

<h3>"What about format items, like time stamp, svr/mod, file/line, thread id?"</h3>
<p>
    Given GCC and C99 style variadic macros, I can use string concatenation
    to add extra formatting arguments to a printf string. For example, with
    GCC, the following will prepend "hi! " along with other printf
    content with each invocation of MY_PRINTF():
    <pre>
    #define MY_PRINTF(FMT, ARGS...) printf("%s" FMT , "hi! " , ##ARGS)
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    I originally intended the file/line elements to be a single entity.
    I found that concatinating the name with the line (when converted to
    a string) caused some compilers to store a ton of duplicate data.
    For example: "myfile.cpp[123]" and "myfile.cpp[125]". That is, the
    file name was being duplicated once for every single log call. In some
    source files with lots of log calls, this was significant. I also found
    that some compilers generate full-path file names which not only made
    the magnitude of the duplication ridiculous but made the formatting ugly.
    So, I wrote a function to seek past the last '/' (or '\\') character in
    the file name string. It solved both of those problems. The cost was
    that the file/line format now has two arguments. Performance-wise,
    I figured the boost from not outputting the full path outweighed the
    cost of finding the base name and passing an extra parameter. So it's
    mostly a win.
</p>
<p>
    The reason that the __LINE__ is not passed as a %d is because I like
    the file and line pair to look like "%s[%d]". Since the format strings
    stay the same even when format values are configured off, that would
    leave a "[0]" in the output when line numbers are disabled.
</p>
<p>
    Originally, the format generation was baked into the configuration script.
    It bothered me that a perl script had to know about the timestamp and
    thread id functions, but I wasn't sure how else to do it. Then, when I
    decided to create the X-Macro only configuration, I realized that the
    format stuff needed to be done using X-Macros instead. This presented
    a series of trade-offs:
    <ul>
        <li>Pro: the perl script no longer needed to know about the
            timestamp or thread id functions (or formatting at all).</li>
        <li>Pro: the user could define whatever they wanted as their
            format, in any order.</li>
        <li>Con: the run-time configuration is on a per item basis, so
            things like file/line are seperately configured.</li>
        <li>Con: there are two partly redundant X-Macros for formatting.
            This happens because there are two parts to each format item,
            the format specified (e.g. "%s") and the value. Though I'm
            investigating if I merge these two macros now.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    One other thing. Things like a timestamp may require local storage to
    be thread safe. I let the user declare the following macro to
    instantiate the required storage within each FLOG()/FLOGS() call
    (in local scope):
    <pre>
    FLOG_FORMAT_DEC
    </pre>
    Some compilers will instantiate this item once at the start of a
    function for all FLOG() calls therein. That boost stack size a ton.
    If this really bothers the user, they can create some thread-local
    storage outside the Flog configuration and reference that.
</p>

<h3>"Can formatting options be supported with non-variadic preprocessors?"</h3>
<p>
    My gut says, "No." I'd have to think about it some more.
</p>

<h3>"Can formatting options be both compile-time and run-time configurable?</h3>
<p>
    For run-time, each option can check a flag to see if it's currently
    enabled and then pass in either an empty string or the valid value
    accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    I solved this once when formatting was defined by the perl script and
    again when using X-Macros. The X-Macro version is more obfuscated and
    clumsy. But it works. Either way, the preprocessor ends up with
    something like this for the typical series of format elements:
</p>
<p>
    <pre>
    FLOG_TIME_DEC;
    FLOG_PRINTF("%s%d %s%s%s%s%s" FMT ,
            FLOG_FLAG(TIMESTAMP) ? FLOG_TIME(FLOG_TIME_ARG) : "" ,
            FLOG_THREAD() ,
            FLOG_FLAG(SEVMOD) ? #SEVERITY "[" #MODULE "] " : "" ,
            FLOG_FLAG(FILELINE) ? FILE_SHORTEN(__FILE__) : "" ,
            FLOG_FLAG(FILELINE) ? LINETOSTRING(__LINE__) : "" ,
            FLOG_FLAG(FUNCTION) ? __FUNCTION__ : "" ,
            FLOG_FLAG(FUNCTION) ? "() " : "" ,
            ##ARGS);
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Each format item can be specified as 'always on', 'configurable on'
    and 'configurable off'. Or it can be removed from the format
    X-Macros to make it 'always off'.
</p>
<p>
    Also, that's getting pretty hefty...
</p>

<h3>"Can the code size and number of parameters be reduced?"</h3>
<p>
    The extra parameters to FLOG_PRINTF() may be concerning to some.
    In the main example, the following individual arguments are passed
    to each FLOG() call:
    <ul>
        <li>timestamp string</li>
        <li>thread id</li>
        <li>severity[module]</li>
        <li>filename</li>
        <li>line number</li>
        <li>function name</li>
        <li>the "()" string for the function name</li>
    </ul>
    Other than disabling them, is there a way to reduce size?
    The timestamp and thread id could be generated from the output
    function itself instead of getting created and passed by every
    invocation of FLOG.  The severity/module, filename, line number
    and function name, on the other hand, all must be referenced
    (and/or passed) locally since that's where they come from.
    I haven't bothered to fix this since the code size difference
    hasn't been a big deal.
</p>
<p>
    Note also that the timestamp can be generated by the remote
    logging facility if it's sent out a serial port or over UDP. 
</p>
<p>
    Also, the run-time configuration code itself can be disabled
    by setting FLOG_STATIC. The 'static' example does this just
    'cause it can. I've worked on platforms in the past that had
    very little breathing room for debug code. In such cases,
    every little bit counts. Disabling run-time checks improves
    performance slightly, too, so that's another help on such platforms.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, the module and severity are concatenated by the preprocessor.
    They are not concatenated with the main FMT string as that
    would bloat code like crazy. Still, it would probably reduce
    code size in most cases to split the module and severity into
    seperate format items. It's very likely that the code size increase
    from adding an extra parameter to the FLOG_PRINTF() call is
    smaller than the savings achieved by a compiler that could
    now consolidate the redundant severities and modules.
    Also, concatenating the strings with the main FMT string would
    make them unconfigurable at run-time.
</p>

<h3>"What about writing a printf function that doesn't require format strings?"</h3>
<p>
    Another option that I haven't really explored would be to create a
    function to replace (or encapsulate) printf with a number of extra
    arguments. For example:
    <pre>
    int special_printf(const char * fmt,
            const char * severity,
            const char * module,
            const char * filename,
            int line,
            const char * function,
            ...);
    </pre>
    The advantage should be reduced code size since the extra format strings
    aren't used. The disadvantage would be that I'd have to rewrite a big
    hunk of Flog. Meh.
</p>
<p>
    If one were to pursue this path, it's important to only do the output in
    a single step (or while holding exclusive control of the output method)
    so that a single log call's output isn't split or corrupted. It'd be
    tempting to plop out each item (if configured) one at a time.
</p>

<h3>"What about the output method?"</h3>
<p>
    Some logging frameworks have log rotation and other advanced
    features. Flog doesn't bother. In most cases, applications/daemons
    can write directly to a log file on disk and external entities
    like logrotate can manage log sizes.
</p>
<p>
    If log sizes or performance are critical, the FLOG_PRINTF routine
    can be overridden with something more creative. Note that it
    should be kept thread safe if the application is multi-threaded.
</p>

<h3>"Installation and configuration is messy."</h3>
<p>
    It's messy because I chose to give the user options. The user is
    in full control of most every aspect of Flog, defining each of
    the following items:
    <ul>
        <li>Severities</li>
        <li>Modules and their max/default severities</li>
        <li>Format items</li>
        <li>Output method</li>
        <li>Dynamic vs static-only configuration</li>
    </ul>
    I think the compile-time configuration of all those things is
    what makes it complicated. It's easy to write APIs that do
    all these things. It's harder to do all those things at compile-time.
</p>
<p>
    I convinced myself that the flog_config.pl script isn't always
    required and let there be an X-Macro-only configuration.
</p>
<p>
    For run-time configuration, the flog.c file must be compiled and
    linked into a project. And the user must call flog_init() before
    using any other Flog APIs. The icky part is that flog.c must be
    recompiled with the header flog header, either the one generated by
    the user or the one generated by flog_config.pl. Since it's user defined,
    I chose to let the user either modify flog.c to include the appropriate
    header, or #include flog.c in a source file that includes the user's
    header. Either way, yuck.
</p>
<p>
    Also, when using flog_config.pl, the flog header must be regenerated
    whenever the configuration changes. This should be added to the build
    system if possible.
</p>

<h2>Review</h2>

<p>
    How close did I stay to the vision?
</p>

<h3>Consistency across ALL code</h3>
<p>
    This is more a question of implementation within a project or series
    of projects. An easy-to-use interface facilitates that, though. Other
    than installation and first-time configuration, I think Flog is easy
    to use. Just include the header file and write FLOG calls.
</p>

<h3>Simple syntax</h3>
<p>
    The inclusion of both the severity and the module in each log call
    increases the amount of syntax compared to some logging tools.
</p>

<h3>Zero cost (or close to it) when inhibited</h3>
<p>
    Mission accomplished ... at the expense of configuration and
    installation issues.
</p>

<h3>Run time configurability on a per-module basis</h3>
<p>
    Yup
</p>

<h3>Configurable output formatting</h3>
<p>
    Yup
</p>

<h3>Configurable output destination(s)</h3>
<p>
    Yup
</p>

<h3>Works with C and C++</h3>
<p>
    Yup-ish. It's really just C. Though C is a subset (of sorts) of C++.
    The C++ ostream interface requires parentheses which is a little
    off.
</p>

<h3>Thread safe (i.e. each log line is whole)</h3>
<p>
    Yup.
</p>
<p>
    Only one FLOG_PRINTF call is made per log call. Although, this
    depends on FLOG_PRINTF being thread-safe. Usually fprintf() is.
    The one naughty part is that the timestamp is gleaned in a seperate
    call before invoking FLOG_PRINTF, so it might be out-of-date slightly.
    That is, a sample chronology (for either single or multi processing):
    <pre>
    1 ThreadA.FLOG()
    2 ThreadA.timestamp()
    4 ThreadB.FLOG()
    5 ThreadB.timestamp()
    6 ThreadB.FLOG_PRINTF()
