<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>
    Back in 2010, I worked on an embedded C/C++ project that had some
    terrible logging code. The target platforms had no debug facilities
    (JTAG or otherwise), just some slow serial output. The lack of
    debugging features made logging a critical feature. Yet, it was
    really terrible.
</p>
<p>
    It was clear what was <b>wrong</b> with the existing logging code:
    <ul>
        <li>It was incosistent. Different modules used different logging
            APIs (I guess depending on who wrote it or when). Different
            compile-time configurations were required to enable the code
            in each type.</li>
        <li>Compile-time configuration was largely all or nothing. There
            was no fine-grained control of small portions of the code
            base. Enabling debug level logging bloated the code size so
            much that it wouldn't load on some of the target platforms. On
            all target platforms, debug logging would flood the serial
            port and make the product unusable. In other words, the
            compile-time configuration was useless because it lacked
            fine-grained control.</li>
        <li>There was no run-time configuration.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately -- or perhaps exactly what one should expect in this
    profession -- the customer asked us to change as little as possible
    to get the features they wanted. That meant I couldn't just go through
    and "fix" all logging code.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not a complainer (much), so I added temporary debug features where
    needed. If the box wasn't behaving right, I'd pepper the suspect code
    with debug output that would print the file name and line number only.
    I could get a pretty good handle on what was going on without flooding
    the serial port or changing the system's behavior too much. I also
    added an optional circular buffer that would store the last ~32 KB of
    log output and only send on the serial port after a bad state had been
    detected.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, another group at our office was working in parallel on
    porting the system to yet another platform. Like my group, they were
    not permitted to rewrite the icky portions. But they could write their
    brand new platform code <b><em>right</em></b>. They wrote a logging API
    that included compile-time configuration of severities on a per-module
    basis. I thought it was pretty good. I thought it could be better.
</p>
<p>
    Then our half of the project was discontinued. And a new internal
    project was created to make an actual product. I was assigned to
    make one of the core components on that new product. At that moment,
    I vowed to do logging right because of the pain I'd suffered the
    whole year prior.
</p>
<p>
    Fast forward to now, I've been granted permission to shared this code 
    and my experiences around it. Thanks to

<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>
    The main features I wanted from logging APIs:
    <ul>
        <li>Consistency across ALL code</li>
        <li>Simple syntax</li>
        <li>Zero cost (or close to it) when inhibited</li>
        <li>Run time configurability on a per-module basis</li>
        <li>Configurable output formatting</li>
        <li>Configurable output destination(s)</li>
        <li>Compatible with C and C++</li>
        <li>Thread safe (i.e. ordered, un-mangled output)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    These requirements all seemed compatible, so I set out to design and
    write the code (sometimes not in that particular order...). Mostly,
    I'd just ask myself questions and try to come up with answers until
    I ran out of questions I couldn't answer. Is that how design is
    supposed to work?
</p>
<p>
    The current implementation of what I now call
    <a href="http://github.com/bilken/Flog/"> Flog</a> is available for
    viewing.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>"What should log calls look like?"</h3>
<p>
    I happen to like printf-style syntax, so I decided it could just do
    that. As far as the severity and module specification, I was not so
    sure. My first try looked something like this, partly because that's
    what'd I'd seen before (from the other group's project in the Preface):
    <pre>
    FLOG_DEBUG(MODULE1, "Some stuff %d\n", x);
    </pre>
</p>

<h3>"How do I reduce the run-time cost of inhibited log statements
    to zero?"</h3>
<p>
    Some compilers will remove unused statements like
    <pre>
    if (0) {...}
    </pre>
    Some won't, though. So I decided the preprocessor would be required
    for a truly portable solution to compile-time configuration.
</p>

<h3>"How do I define modules and severities?"</h3>
<h3>"How do I define macros for each module and severity?"</h3>
<p>
    These questions were tricky and are the source of one of the grossest
    parts of the implementation. I decided that it'd be easiest to define
    the severities and modules in a seperate configuration file. I chose
    to write a Perl script, flog_config.pl, to parse the configuration and
    generate a header with all the necessary declarations.
</p>
<p>
    However, I could solve these issues with X-macros. Something like this:
    <pre>
    /* Available severities */
    #define FLOG_SEVERITIES \
        FLOG_SVR(DEBUG) \
        FLOG_SVR(INFO) \
        FLOG_SVR(ERROR) \

    /* Module name, compile-time maximum, run-time default */
    #define FLOG_MODULES \
        FLOG_MOD(FOO, DEBUG, INFO) \
        FLOG_MOD(BAR, INFO, ERROR) \

    ...

    enum flog_svr {
        FLOG_SVR_INVALID = -1,
    #define FLOG_SVR(SVR) FLOG_SVR_##MOD,
        FLOG_MODULES
    #undef FLOG_SVR
        FLOG_SVR_NONE,
    };
        
    enum flog_mod_max {
    #define FLOG_MOD(MOD, MAX, DEF) FLOG_MOD_MAX_##MOD = FLOG_SVR_##MAX,
        FLOG_MODULES
    #undef FLOG_MOD
    };

    #define FLOG(SEV, MOD, FMT, ARGS...) \
        if (FLOG_SVR_##SEV &gt;&eq; FLOG_MOD_MAX_##MOD)) { \
            _FLOG_DO(SEV, MOD, FMT , ##ARGS ); \
        }
    </pre>
    However, the X-macro approach will depend on the compiler to optimize
    out a constant condition, such as:
    <pre>
    if (3 &lt; 2) { ... }
    </pre>
    I'd already decided not to do that.
</p>

<h3>"Why is the severity in the macro name but the module is a parameter?"</h3>
<p>
    Yeah, that's weird. So I made it so that both of the following are valid:
    <pre>
    FLOG(FOOSEV, BARMOD, "fmt %d\n", num);
    FLOG_FOOSEV_BARMOD("fmt %d\n", num);
    </pre>
</p>

<h3>"Are variadic macros universally supported?"</h3>
<p>
    Nope. There's basically GCC-style, C99 or just "no". It's not
    too hard to support both GCC and C99 styles with a couple #ifdefs.
    There is a little mess with C99 in order to support the no-parameter
    case:
    <pre>
    FLOG(FOOSEV, BARMOD, "No extra args\n");
    </pre>
    The mess is that I had to pass an extra empty string parameter
    and add an extra %s to the format string. Oh, well.
</p>
<p>
    I haven't fully decided what to do if variadic macros aren't
    supported. My original implementation was going to have compile-time
    configuration but no run-time configuration in such cases. An extra
    preprocessing tool would be run on each source file to convert all
    FLOG(FOOSEV, BARMOD, ...) calls to DP_FLOG_FOOSEV_BARMOD(...) which
    could then be defined to nothing to inhibit the call or to the output
    routine if not. The extra script was kludgy, so I dropped it.
</p>

<h3>"How do I do run-time configuration?"</h3>
<p>
    At first, I wrote flog_get_severity() and flog_set_severity()
    (or something like that). But I never used it directly in my projects.
    Instead, I always ended up writing a little wrapper that would take
    command line or console input and adjust the logging accordingly.
    So I just plopped that code in flog.c and called it good. It now
    exists as:
    <pre>
    int flog_interact_s(const char *arg, char *outStr, size_t outStrLen);
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    This call outputs to a user-supplied string because I wasn't sure
    what else to output to. It could send directly to FLOG_PRINTF(),
    but then the syntax won't match other FLOG() calls. Or it could
    require that there be a LOG module, but that's hidden behavior.
    So I settled on letting the application decide where output should
    go, if anywhere.
</p>

<h3>"vsnprintf() crashes sometimes...why?"</h3>
<p>
    I discovered that vsnprintf() isn't strict about the string length
    I was passing in (at least with glibc). So it was crashing if
    it ran out of space (because it would keep writing past the end
    of my allocated output buffer!).
    My solution was to ... allocate a bigger buffer. Note that this
    only matters in calls to flog_interact_s() (or the test code)
    as that's the only thing that uses this call. In practice, I haven't
    had any problems with this. I definitely wouldn't expose this
    functionality to anything user accessible, though.
</p>

<h3>"What about C++?"</h3>
<p>
    At first, I was going to support output of both std::string and
    std::ostream arguments. I dropped the std::string because strings
    can be output by an ostream.
    <pre>
    FLOGS(DEBUG, MODULE1, "Text " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; std::endl);
    </pre>
    Under the covers, it creates a std::ostringstream from the contents
    of FLOGS() and passes that to the internal printf-style function as
    a single string argument (i.e. "%s", oss.str().c_str()). Note that
    it needs to check the run-time setting before doing any real work.
    If the module's severity is inhibited, the ostringstream should not
    get used (or created on the stack if possible).
</p>
<p>
    Note that since C++ output is a single expression, variadic macro
    support isn't required. I suddenly like printf-style syntax less...
</p>

<h3>"What about format items, like time stamp, svr/mod, file/line, thread id?"</h3>
<p>
    Given GCC and C99 style variadic macros, I can use string concatenation
    to add extra formatting arguments to a printf string. And I can insert
    extra arguments either before or after all other existing arguments.
    I chose to put all the extra formatting items before, but that could be
    changed. So the output looks something like:
    <pre>
    2012-04-06 14:30:53.415 6056 INFO[TEST] test.cpp[55] main() Test output works!
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Note, the timestamp output probably requires storage. I let the user
    declare the following macros to instantiate and pass the required storage:
    <pre>
    FLOG_TIME_DEC
    FLOG_TIME_ARG
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Here's an approximation of what a FLOG call looks like after it's passed
    the compile-time and run-time checks (for GCC-style varadic macros):
    <pre>
    FLOG_TIME_DEC;
    FLOG_PRINTF("%s%d %s%s%s%s%s" FMT ,
            FLOG_TIME(FLOG_TIME_ARG),
            FLOG_THREAD() ,
            #SEVERITY "[" #MODULE "] ",
            FILE_SHORTEN(__FILE__),
            LINETOSTRING(__LINE__),
            __FUNCTION__,
            "() ",
            ##ARGS);
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    The flog_config.pl script can only emit the format options that are
    enabled at compile-time.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not sure what would be required to support these features with
    non-variadic macros.
</p>

<h3>"Can formatting options be both compile-time and run-time configurable?</h3>
<p>
    For run-time, each option can check a flag to see if it's currently
    enabled and then pass in either an empty string or the valid value
    accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    <pre>
    FLOG_TIME_DEC;
    FLOG_PRINTF("%s%d %s%s%s%s%s" FMT ,
            FLOG_FLAG(TIMESTAMP) ? FLOG_TIME(FLOG_TIME_ARG) : "" ,
            FLOG_THREAD() ,
            FLOG_FLAG(SEVMOD) ? #SEVERITY "[" #MODULE "] " : "" ,
            FLOG_FLAG(FILELINE) ? FILE_SHORTEN(__FILE__) : "" ,
            FLOG_FLAG(FILELINE) ? LINETOSTRING(__LINE__) : "" ,
            FLOG_FLAG(FUNCTION) ? __FUNCTION__ : "" ,
            FLOG_FLAG(FUNCTION) ? "() " : "" ,
            ##ARGS);
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Note that the flog_config.pl script allows the user to specify each
    of these as being always on or off, or run-time configurable. When
    they're always on, the FLOG_FLAG() section and ternary operator is
    omitted. When they're always off, the format and argument(s) for that
    format option are fully omitted.
</p>
<p>
    Also, that's getting pretty hefty...
</p>

<h3>"Can the code size and number of parameters be reduced?"</h3>
<p>
    At this point, there are up to 7 extra parameters to printf:
    <ul>
        <li>timestamp string</li>
        <li>thread id</li>
        <li>severity[module]</li>
        <li>filename</li>
        <li>line number</li>
        <li>function name</li>
        <li>the "()" string for the function name</li>
    </ul>
    Other than disabling them, is there a way to reduce size?
    The timestamp and thread id could be generated from the output
    function itself instead of getting created and passed by every
    invocation of FLOG.  The severity/module, filename, line number
    and function name, on the other hand, all must be referenced
    (and/or passed) locally since that's where they come from.
    I haven't bothered to fix this since the code size difference
    hasn't been a big deal.
</p>
<p>
    Note also that the timestamp can be generated by the remote
    logging facility if it's sent out a serial port or over UDP. 
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, the run-time configuration code itself can be disabled
    by setting FLOG_STATIC. The 'static' example does this just
    'cause it can. I've worked on platforms in the past that had
    very little breathing room for debug code. In such cases,
    every little bit counts. Disabling run-time checks improves
    performance slightly, too, so that's another help on such platforms.
</p>

<h3>"What about redundant file name and module/severity strings?"</h3>
<p>
    These are used "as-is" in the code. That way, the compiler has the
    option of re-using duplicated strings. Of course, some compilers
    are not sufficiently smart.
</p>
<p>
    Note that this is in contrast to concatenating the strings in
    each call. For example, the following could be done to perhaps
    boost performance at the expense of code size:
    <pre>
    FLOG_PRINTF(
            #SEVERITY "[" #MODULE "] "
            __FILE__
            LINETOSTRING(__LINE__)
            "%s%s%s() " FMT ,
            __FUNCTION__,
            ##ARGS);
    </pre>
    Note also that the formatting is no longer run-time configurable.
</p>

<h3>"Can the format ordering be changed?"</h3>
<p>
    The flog_config.pl script could be tweaked to do so, perhaps via
    encodings in the configuration file. I'd probably just hardcode
    things if I needed to change the order.
</p>

<h3>"What about the output method?"</h3>
<p>
    Some logging frameworks have log rotation and other advanced
    features. Flog doesn't bother. In most cases, applications/daemons
    can write directly to a log file on disk and external entities
    like logrotate can manage log sizes.
</p>
<p>
    If log sizes or performance are critical, the FLOG_PRINTF routine
    can be overridden with something more creative. Note that it
    should be kept thread safe if the application is multi-threaded.
</p>

<h3>"Installation and configuration is a disaster."</h3>
<p>
    That wasn't a question.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the configuration file used by the flog_config.pl script,
    it's not a formal format. But it's pretty simple and intuitive
    (says the guy that created it...). I think xml/xsd would be
    super overkill. Not sure what else I could do. Maybe make it
    perl code that gets imported by the perl script...? Eek. Or leave
    it alone.
</p>
<p>
    As for installation, the Flog framework is mostly a header, the one
    generated by the flog_config.pl script. For run-time configuration,
    however, the companion flog.c file must be compiled and linked into
    a project. The icky part is that flog.c must be recompiled with the
    header generated by flog_config.pl. But that header is user-defined.
</p>
<p>
    My current solution is to have the user either modify flog.c
    to include the appropriate header, or #include flog.c in a source
    file that includes the user's header. Either way, yuck.
</p>
<p>
    Don't forget that the flog header must be regenerated whenever the
    configuration changes. This should be added to the build system
    if possible.
</p>
<p>
    And this is what makes me wonder if the X-macro only solution might
    have been the better compromise.
</p>

<h2>Review</h2>

<p>
    How close did I stay to the vision?
</p>

<h3>Consistency across ALL code</h3>
<p>
    This is more a question of implementation within a project or series
    of projects. An easy-to-use interface facilitates that, though. Other
    than installation and first-time configuration, I think Flog is easy
    to use. Just include the header file and write FLOG calls.
</p>

<h3>Simple syntax</h3>
<p>
    The inclusion of both the severity and the module in each log call
    increases the amount of syntax compared to some logging tools.
</p>

<h3>Zero cost (or close to it) when inhibited</h3>
<p>
    Mission accomplished ... at the expense of configuration and
    installation issues.
</p>

<h3>Run time configurability on a per-module basis</h3>
<p>
    Yup
</p>

<h3>Configurable output formatting</h3>
<p>
    Yup
</p>

<h3>Configurable output destination(s)</h3>
<p>
    Yup
</p>

<h3>Works with C and C++</h3>
<p>
    Yup-ish. It's really just C. Though C is a subset (of sorts) of C++.
    The C++ ostream interface requires parentheses which is a little
    off.
</p>

<h3>Thread safe (i.e. each log line is whole)</h3>
<p>
    Yup.
</p>
<p>
    Only one FLOG_PRINTF call is made per log call. Although, this
    depends on FLOG_PRINTF being thread-safe. Usually fprintf() is.
    The one naughty part is that the timestamp is gleaned in a seperate
    call before invoking FLOG_PRINTF, so it might be out-of-date slightly.
    That is, a chronology (for either single or multi processing):
    <pre>
    1 ThreadA.FLOG()
    2 ThreadA.timestamp()
    4 ThreadB.FLOG()
    5 ThreadB.timestamp()
    6 ThreadB.FLOG_PRINTF()
    7 ThreadA.FLOG_PRINTF()
    </pre>
    Note that the timestamps may be out of order (if the timestamp
    precision is sufficiently high).
